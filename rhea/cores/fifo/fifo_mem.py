    """ Memory module used by FIFOs
    The write data takes two `clock_w` clock cycles to be latched 
    into the memory array and one `clock_r` clock cycle to be latched
    into `read_data`.

    Arguments:
       clock_w: write clock
       write: write enable
       write_data: write data bus
       write_addr: write address bus
       clock_r: read clock
       read: read strobe, loads the next address into the output reg
       read_data: read data bus
       read_addr: read address bus
       write_addr_delayed: the write data takes multiple clock cycles
           before it is available in the memory (pipelines before and
           and after the memory array).  This is a delayed version of
           the write_addr that matches the write_data delay.

        mem_size (int): number of item entries in the memory.
